# rc

The non-configurable configuration loader for lazy people.

## Usage

The only option is to pass rc the name of your app, and your default configuration.

```javascript
var conf = require('rc')(appname, {
  //defaults go here.
  port: 2468,

  //defaults which are objects will be merged, not replaced
  views: {
    engine: 'jade'
  }
});
```

`rc` will return your configuration options merged with the defaults you specify.
If you pass in a predefined defaults object, it will be mutated:
