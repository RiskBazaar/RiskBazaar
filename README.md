# RiskBazaar

RiskBazaar is currently developing a platform that facilitates peer-to-peer wagers with pre-defined payouts, contingent on the occurrence of future events. Prototype __risk contracts__ which include not only wagers but also conditional payments and insurance contracts are also being developed. The expectation is that our burgeoning platform will display the dependability and flexibility required for longer term contracts to be issued with higher and more variable future payouts.

More coming soon...
